Well believe it or not, you might have imposter syndrome( feeling that you aren't worthy);
if not that, you have some reason, that makes you undeeconfident.
<br>
Here are some reasons/ conditions present in your life:
 <ul style="color: var(--font_light_grey);">

  <li style="color: inherit;">You aren't involved in social activities/social gatherings.</li>
  <li style="color: inherit;">You either haven't been consistent in your goals or haven't even set goals.</li>
  <li style="color: inherit;">You are obesse, or addicted to drugs, sugary drink, fast foods (unhealthy foods), alchahol.</li>
  <li style="color: inherit;">You are mentally unstable; generally overthink or overfantacize situations.</li>
  <li style="color: inherit;">Also, you aren't working on anything that will stablize you mentally.</li>

<h2> Your Brain isn't DUMB FU*K! </h2>
<p class="blog__list">
Bro, your brain isn't dumb! It sees your mind, body and environment is Fucked UP! 
It will be obvious, that you aren't in best form of your.
<br>
You will feel sorry for yourself, feel underconfident, 
infact you will also try to exploit the power/ authority on the weaker.
<br>
Let's say you are babysitting some child,
you will try to exercise your power here;
which you coundn't exercise out in real world.
<br>
In real world you will be initially shy and introvert;
later you will be either people pleasing or will try to avoid people.
<br>
The point here is,
that don't think you could fake confidence,
nither acting it out will help! Your Brain is real smart!
</p>

<h2> Let's fuckin solve it! </h2>
<p class="blog__list">
Hey Dawg! I know and yourr brain knows it, that you'r in the most fucked up situation. 
But listen, "There is a WAY Out !".
It is : You have to work on yourself,
I mean devotionally, and consistently.
<br>
Do one thing consistently, every single day; like for an hour.
Those five minutes daily shit don't work. 
It's lazinees and you might don't care about that five minutes walk.
Trust me on this, devote a hour every single day without fail and you will start restoring your confidence.
<br>
It happens simply for the fact that ; You are getting better and for sure your brain feels it.
Thats the reason, why majority of gym guys are naturally confident.
<br>
Here again:
<ul style="color: var(--font_light_grey);">
  <li>Do ane hing to improve yourself without fail, everyday. 
  To get better results, do the activity which is physical in nature like gym.</li>
  <li>Don't shy out in putting efforts. 
  Get off your ass from the coutch and put your efforts all in.
  Work like this is your last opportunity.</li>
  <li>Mark the day on the calender and reward yourself for it.</li>
  <li>Dont give up be consistent !!!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>This wil automatically restore your confidence;
You will start feeling that you are way better than others!!!
<br>
Peace out!
