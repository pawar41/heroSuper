    I am the hero of my life. Now imagine that a hero doesn't want to show up on stage & in front of the camera. That's me!
</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
   Well, am I an Introvert? Am I more mature than others? Not really ðŸ˜”, I am scared & haunted by the fact that "What will people think?".
</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    Over years, I have wired feelings about going in any spotlight event. Like when I got to my college on the first day; I tried to rock ON! BE COOL! Be in the spotlight, ask questions & all. What happened at the end? I ended up arguing with the teacher & I was dumped out by him.
</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    No worries, that was enough to squeeze out the monster of "What will people think?" & from then onwards underconfident & I am avoiding college let's say.
</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    When I was a kid, I didn't like to go to tuition. It was too boring. Then I will pull out books & start doing acting of studying just a few minutes before tuition & ask mom; to please let me stay home. I used to say, "I will study at home". In short giving reasons for other things to avoid some things.

</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    That's what I am doing now. I think I give a bit of silly reason. "I want to learn to code", "I have some scholarship exam", "Not feeling well", "They are teaching nothing in collage" & whatnot; to avoid it.
</p>

<h2> 
    How I killed MONSTER
</h2>
<p class="blog__list">    
    Is there any way, that I can be free from this introvert bullshit? I am afraid to talk to girls, & innumerable things I want to do. 
<br> 
    JUST BECAUSE I AM SCARED! & I don't know what am I exactly scared of? & why?
</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    To kill your fear, you will need to make your hero the SUPERHERO.
</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    How? Well here is another story. I used to love to play basket-ball. Unfortunately, I dont have courage to ask anyone today, if I see some kids playing; I give out silly reasons like, "I am not a kid anymore", "I have important things to do" & all.
</p>

    How? Well here is another story. I used to love to play basketball. Unfortunately, I don't dare to ask anyone today, if I see some kids playing; I give out silly reasons like, "I am not a kid anymore", "I have important things to do" & all.
    But, back then when I used to play it; it boosted my confidence. Enough to ask a few girls to play with me( basketball only). I used to feel like I am different, special & superior. I used to work out, exercise, run & follow a proper diet. I was an almost perfect version of myself. but a way better than my colleagues.

</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    Thus, I was confident in speaking to them. But, was that good thinking? Like I am superior? I don't know! But, it boosted my confidence; being physically better boosted my confidence. I don't know Why? But maybe that's my physical body feeling.
</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    If suddenly everybody starts respecting me tomorrow or let's say I got popular, my confidence will automatically grow (but within my mind).

</p>

<h2>
    How to boost confidence?
</h2>

<p class="blog__list">    
    Well, confidence has to do something with being special in some kind of thing.
</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    Like, if you are extraordinary in your study, you will be confident when it's about studying. You will ask freely & confidently your doughts. Studying will be a natural environment for you.
</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    If you are extraordinary physically; you will be confident when it's about physical combat, games, etc.

</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    If you look good; you will confident in talking to the opposite gender, any modeling competition, etc.

</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    It's knowing you have the gun in that situation, it's knowing you are special, it's knowing you are best!

</p>

<h2> Well the opposite is also true </h2>
<p class="blog__list">    
    If you feel you are lacking something, you are automatically underconfident.

</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    If I think, I don't look good, if I have spots on my face, I will try to hide my face, avoid interactions & will stay underconfident.

</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    Whereas I know I am good at coding, I am already ahead with confidence.

</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    Suppose, someone without hands (handicapped) will feel underconfident because they don't have something that others have. 
<br>
    On the other hand, they might play Paralympics & feel they are special and blessed.

</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    Some people don't understand studies, a better word is remembering & thus, they are underconfident there.
</p>
<p class="blog__list">    
    Someone...... Some people...... Somebody..... Everyone has an Xcelerator of confidence. That is managed by the brain, which presses a paddle of confidence if you are already in a good position. 

<br>  
    Or it removes pressure from confidence peddle if you are in bad condition, unaware & haunted.
